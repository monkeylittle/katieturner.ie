[{"categories":["Adventure"],"contents":"The day following the final round of The Bog Trials the organiser, Mick, arranged for a social gravel spin around the Galway Wind Park. If you\u0026rsquo;ve never been to the Galway Wind Park, it is the biggest wind park in Ireland and has over 100 electricity generating wind turbines. Throughout the park there is a network of gravel roads around which Mick had planned three different routes for people of different skill and ability.\nI started off the day with a lovely breakfast from a nearby hotel. I travelled with my mum, dad, sister and brother. Unfortunately we ended up getting lost on the way there but luckily we weren\u0026rsquo;t too far away and a few phone calls later we arrived at the right spot.\nAs we were slightly late to arrive I had to rush to get the bikes unloaded, bidons filled and get into my kit. While I was getting myself ready to go for the spin I was able to chat to some of the riders who had raced The Bog Trials series. It was a sunny but breezy day and you could feel the cold nipping at your nose.\nMy mum, brother (Josh) and sister (Molly) rode the shorter route while my dad and I rode the slightly longer route. Three kilometres in and I was descending after a short little kicker, my dad had super tucked his way past me then I saw him pull over on the side of the rocky road. He had a puncture and as we were in a bit of a rush we forgot to pack tubes. Kindly, four nice men from our group stopped and helped us out.\nThere was a really nice view from the top of a nasty leg burner where we then met some very friendly goats. They were lounging by a wind turbine where the little goats were prancing about. We talked about bikes, races and the damp roads as we made our way through a narrow winding pathway. As we made our way up the final stretch my dad attacked for fun and I followed beating him, of course. We pulled over beside our cars and said goodbye to all the people we met that day.\nAll in all, we had a fantastic day out which was a great finish to The Bog Trials.\n","date":"February 26, 2023","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cpicture\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_3982_hu1a5495eae3c79694bb7c7437be26d97e_1351910_545x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 575px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_3982_hu1a5495eae3c79694bb7c7437be26d97e_1351910_600x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 767px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_3982_hu1a5495eae3c79694bb7c7437be26d97e_1351910_700x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 991px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_3982_hu1a5495eae3c79694bb7c7437be26d97e_1351910_1110x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\" \u003e\n  \u003cimg  loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/IMG_3982_hu1a5495eae3c79694bb7c7437be26d97e_1351910_1110x0_resize_q90_box.jpeg\"class=\"  img-fluid\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\"\u003e\n\u003c/picture\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/post-5/","title":"Galway Wind Park"},{"categories":["Race Report"],"contents":"It was the last round of The Bog Trials and that can only mean one thing, burgers. As usual I had a nice long sleep on the way down to the race. When I awoke I was surprised to see the sun was shining. As was becoming tradition, we stopped to get some doughnuts on the way which we share with the other riders. I was a little worried that they were going to melt (or worse still be eaten by Josh). I used the rest of the journey to catch up on some reading.\nWhen we got there we put on our kit, unloaded the bikes and cycled down to the start line to collect our race numbers. I lead Molly and Josh on a pre ride of the course. The pace was high so I think someone must have had their Weetabix. After the pre ride I put on some warm kit while I watched the other races.\nThe under age race was up first. They shot off the start line like lightning. By the time that I got my cow bells from the bag they had already zoomed past. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe how fast they completed the first lap. Molly and Josh were off the front and had a small gap to the third place rider with one lap to go. As they were approaching the finish line we knew it was going to be close. Putting each other under pressure they exchanged glances\u0026hellip;who was going to go first? I couldn\u0026rsquo;t make out who crossed the line first and they are still arguing about it but the race results show Josh as the winner. The finishers had a look of exhaustion but happily munched on their Krispy Kreme doughnut.\nThe B Race was up next and my dad looked focused. He had only gotten a few hours sleep the night before so was very tired but that didn\u0026rsquo;t stop him putting in a few big efforts. He hung on throughout the race to secure the final step on the podium. When he got his breath back he was straight over to the grill and gobbled down a delicious burger.\nI was excited to line out in the women\u0026rsquo;s race again. It was a small field of four but where it lacked in numbers it made up in strength. It was a tough race competing against some amazing women, Laura, Kathrine and Sinead. I focused on a few things that I wanted to work on from the previous race the week before.\nExhausted, Josh lay on the ground beside our gear. He had a fluffy dry robe on and was wrapped up in extra layers. He had fallen asleep, his eyes were closed and you could hear him snoring.\nPost race, I had a burger and I have to say it was one of the best I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had. I even think Josh had an extra one and took another for the journey.\nWe had the prise giving and as happened last year, were awarded a unique prize\u0026hellip;a sod of turf!!! What a fantastic race series.\n","date":"February 25, 2023","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cpicture\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_3895_hue100ba784b29bb1091b7c04569317ab0_1221940_545x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 575px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_3895_hue100ba784b29bb1091b7c04569317ab0_1221940_600x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 767px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_3895_hue100ba784b29bb1091b7c04569317ab0_1221940_700x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 991px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_3895_hue100ba784b29bb1091b7c04569317ab0_1221940_1110x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\" \u003e\n  \u003cimg  loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/IMG_3895_hue100ba784b29bb1091b7c04569317ab0_1221940_1110x0_resize_q90_box.jpeg\"class=\"  img-fluid\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\"\u003e\n\u003c/picture\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/post-4/","title":"The Bog Trials - Round 4"}]
