Thank you Greenmount Cycling Academy for treating us to a spectacular weekend. It was a privilege to get to race in Limerick on Saturday and watch the amazing talent on display all weekend.\nNaturally, I was firstly focused on my own race on Saturday. As I watched the girls I would race against practice the course I realised that Iâ€™m fortunate enough to be in a category with a lot of talented riders. I set about focusing on my own performance and letting the result look after itself.\nBlinkers on, I set about my pre-race routine. My routine before a race has not changed for quite a while but I have been experimenting with ways to reduce being distracted by all the hustle and bustle going on around a race event. There is a lot going on and Iâ€™m glad to have my parents to take care of so many of the details so I can focus on the race ahead.\nGridding done, our race (u14 girls) was lined up behind the u16 girls race. The running order was to be u16 girls, 60 seconds delay, then u14 girls. When you are gridded behind another race like this there is a lot to think about. First I need to get my start right, then I need to focus on my positioning, line, race rhythm etc. within my own race while also thinking about when and where I might catch the back of the u16 race.\nIâ€™m really grateful that in our local, provincial and national races riders are very courteous, giving way if we catch the race ahead. We might also get the occasional shout of encouragement which is the ultimate show of support.\nI didnâ€™t get the start I planned for but quickly moved to the front and set the pace for the first half of the lap. The first part of the lap included a short section of sand, 3 tricky off-camber sections and a much longer sand section. I was first into each of those sections which allowed me to ride them as I wanted.\nImage Credit: SportsPhoto Ireland There was lots of encouragement for the riders and I could hear my name being called along the course. I appreciate all of that support and it means a lot to me. Luke Potter was my pit man for the day (thanks Luke!) which allowed my parents to support me from the sidelines rather than being in the pit.\nImage Credit: SportsPhoto Ireland As I cross the line for the first lap I was 45 seconds up on second place. It\u0026rsquo;s a gap that can quickly disappear so I knew I had to stay focused. I was also making my way through the u16 field. First lap completed I now knew that (1) I had a gap, (2) the field had thinned out so passing would be easier and (3) the race distance would be 3 laps.\nSecond lap I focused on consistency. Keep doing the things that work. The weather was cold and dry which meant the u16/u14 girls are not going to cut up the course so the lines would change little. I didnâ€™t need to take any risks so I ran a little more of the off-camber section. Crossing the line the second time had extended my lead a little further. One more lap!\nEven though I was in a comfortable position there is always the risk of getting distracted. I set about focusing on the wheels ahead. I crossed the line happy and exhaustedâ€¦but mostly happy.\nImage Credit: SportsPhoto Ireland Thanks for the support from Orwell Wheelers but also the many others who help along the way.\n","date":"January 13, 2024","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cpicture\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_1137_hu21871fe805990e14e7ca88c5af0c6fb6_719669_545x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 575px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_1137_hu21871fe805990e14e7ca88c5af0c6fb6_719669_600x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 767px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_1137_hu21871fe805990e14e7ca88c5af0c6fb6_719669_700x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 991px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_1137_hu21871fe805990e14e7ca88c5af0c6fb6_719669_1110x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\" \u003e\n  \u003cimg  loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/IMG_1137_hu21871fe805990e14e7ca88c5af0c6fb6_719669_1110x0_resize_q90_box.jpeg\"class=\"  img-fluid\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\"\u003e\n\u003c/picture\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/20240113/","title":"CX National Championships"},{"categories":["Race Report"],"contents":"Cuchulainn Cycling Club were hosting this years Leinster Time Trial and Road Race Championships. I raced both the TT and road race last year so knew the course quite well. This year would be different as the road race would have an additional two laps.\nI picked up a pastry on the drive to race HQ (it was delicious). The weather looked glum and cloudy but I hoped the rain would hold off. As we got to the course we drove through the first round about and up the long steady climb to race HQ. As my TT time approached it started bucketing down so it was time to put on my jacket. I started my warm up and was lucky to have an awning to shelter under otherwise I would have gotten drenched.\nIt looked like the rain wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to say ciao. Coat on I headed over to the start line. I\u0026rsquo;m still adapting to the longer time trials so I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to spend all of my beans early. In hindsight I definitely could have pushed harder. When I finished the time trial I continued on to the round about to see what it would be like for the road race. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to do much to cool down as it was pretty cold already but I got back to race HQ and hopped on the rollers anyway.\nI\u0026rsquo;m glad that it brightened up for the road race. It was nice and warm and I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to wear my jacket. We had a separate race to the boys and it was a rolling start. There were five of us and four were left once we got to the second round about. We started pushing on the climb and our group of four split in half. I managed to get away with Emer and worked to open up the gap. After a few laps Emer and I caught up to the group of boys and took a rest for a few minutes. Once we had around a lap to go we got off the front of the bunch. It came down to a gruelling, ascending sprint finish. I crossed the line in second behind Emer.\nHappy to stand on the top step for the 2023 Leinster TT and Road Race.

The weather on the drive down suggested it was going to be a warm weekend ðŸŒž. The day before the race we drove the stage one and two route so that we would have more time on race day. We discussed race tactics and how I might animate the race the following day with the focus on what I could learn rather than the result. After a tiring day of travelling it was time to unload the car. We took all of our things into the hotel, brought our suitcases and my bike up to the room before we finally had time to relax. I had my pre-race dinner and hit the room early for a refreshing sleep.\nI woke up early and when I opened the curtains I was delighted to see that the sun was out. After grabbing a take away breakfast and loading the car, we went to race HQ for sign on. I was looking forward to stage 1 because I thought the parcours would suit me. After my usual pre-race warm up I tried to time getting to the pen so that I was still warmed up but was able to get a good start position. The u16 race started ahead of us, followed by the u12 race and then it was go time.\nAs there was no separate race for the girls, we had a big bunch of riders all vying for position. Moving around the bunch was tricky and as I moved up for the first climb I bumped a few elbows. I wanted to attack the first climb to see if I could force a split. I went to the front and put in a hard effort which was then taken up by some of the boys. Going over the top there was a large split in the bunch and I was the only girl who\u0026rsquo;d survived the first effort of the stage. We then had a fast technical descent on which I could feel the wind blowing through my hair. Over the next section there was a lot of traffic on the road which helped some of the dropped riders make their way back to the lead bunch. The last few kilometres were through a town and it looked like the bunch I was in was going to the line. The pace went up on the final climb and it ended in a super fast bunch sprint to the line. I finished the stage 7th overall and just pipped Izzy for 1st girl. I was exhausted but got on the rollers for a cool down before the usual roll out check. Between stage 1 and 2 I made my way back to the hotel, got some quality carbs into me and grabbed as much sleep as I could.\nStage two was a time trial and one of my favourites. Pre-race routine completed I made my way to the start line. Two of the riders in front of me did not make the start so I had no bunnies to chase. It was a ~7km TT which is my first of the longer u14 distances so I was determined to stay focussed. I was happy with my effort but did leave a bit on the course though I can\u0026rsquo;t complain about 6th overall and first girl. Post race there was some slight drizzle which was welcome as I cooled down on the rollers. After the stage, we drove the stage 3 route before going back to the hotel and relaxing over dinner. The efforts of the day then had me fall straight to sleep (with my treasured bike beside me).\nDay 2 (and stage 3) was a much more relaxed affair due to the later start time. I was able to take my time over breakfast and enjoy the drive to Race HQ. On the way over the sun was shining through the car window although by the time I started warming up it was pouring rain (parent promptly called over with an umbrella). By race call up the rain had cleared, the sun was out and it was starting to warm up. We were neutralised until we got around the first corner after which the pace immediately picked up. The boys clearly had a race plan as there were a lot of attacks from the gun. On a slight drag, I tried to get off the front but was quickly closed down. In hindsight the drag was not steep enough. But thats how the race continued until the approach to the finish. In the last kilometre there was vying for position with everyone trying to move up. The finish was a short punchy climb and we attacked hard. The race blew apart and as it did one of the riders deviated from his line edging me in toward the kerb on the side of the road forcing me to tap the brakes. I recovered for 7th overall and 2nd girl behind Izzy (super finish Izzy!). Race finished and I cooled down (in more ways than one).\nNow it was time to chill with the girls, grab an ice-cream before heading to the presentations. I already knew the stage and overall results but was delighted to learn that the u14 Orwell Wheelers girls team took the overall u14 team prize. This was only possible thanks to Carlow Road Cycling Club who had allowed Naoise Byrne to guest ride for us to make up the minimum team size.\nGreat weekend and great racing capped off with a recovery swim at the hotel.\n","date":"April 30, 2023","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cpicture\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_4513_hue9c662733479edbf4c70f1c171c1c0fd_964920_545x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 575px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_4513_hue9c662733479edbf4c70f1c171c1c0fd_964920_600x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 767px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_4513_hue9c662733479edbf4c70f1c171c1c0fd_964920_700x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 991px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_4513_hue9c662733479edbf4c70f1c171c1c0fd_964920_1110x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\" \u003e\n  \u003cimg  loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/IMG_4513_hue9c662733479edbf4c70f1c171c1c0fd_964920_1110x0_resize_q90_box.jpeg\"class=\"  img-fluid\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\"\u003e\n\u003c/picture\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/20230430-2/","title":"Kanturk Youth 2 Day"},{"categories":["Adventure"],"contents":"The day following the final round of The Bog Trials the organiser, Mick, arranged for a social gravel spin around the Galway Wind Park. If you\u0026rsquo;ve never been to the Galway Wind Park, it is the biggest wind park in Ireland and has over 100 electricity generating wind turbines. Throughout the park there is a network of gravel roads around which Mick had planned three different routes for people of different skill and ability.\nI started off the day with a lovely breakfast from a nearby hotel. I travelled with my mum, dad, sister and brother. Unfortunately we ended up getting lost on the way there but luckily we weren\u0026rsquo;t too far away and a few phone calls later we arrived at the right spot.\nAs we were slightly late to arrive I had to rush to get the bikes unloaded, bidons filled and get into my kit. While I was getting myself ready to go for the spin I was able to chat to some of the riders who had raced The Bog Trials series. It was a sunny but breezy day and you could feel the cold nipping at your nose.\nMy mum, brother (Josh) and sister (Molly) rode the shorter route while my dad and I rode the slightly longer route. Three kilometres in and I was descending after a short little kicker, my dad had super tucked his way past me then I saw him pull over on the side of the rocky road. He had a puncture and as we were in a bit of a rush we forgot to pack tubes. Kindly, four nice men from our group stopped and helped us out.\nThere was a really nice view from the top of a nasty leg burner where we then met some very friendly goats. They were lounging by a wind turbine where the little goats were prancing about. We talked about bikes, races and the damp roads as we made our way through a narrow winding pathway. As we made our way up the final stretch my dad attacked for fun and I followed beating him, of course. We pulled over beside our cars and said goodbye to all the people we met that day.\nAll in all, we had a fantastic day out which was a great finish to The Bog Trials.\n","date":"February 26, 2023","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cpicture\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_3982_hu1a5495eae3c79694bb7c7437be26d97e_1351910_545x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 575px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_3982_hu1a5495eae3c79694bb7c7437be26d97e_1351910_600x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 767px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_3982_hu1a5495eae3c79694bb7c7437be26d97e_1351910_700x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 991px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_3982_hu1a5495eae3c79694bb7c7437be26d97e_1351910_1110x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\" \u003e\n  \u003cimg  loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/IMG_3982_hu1a5495eae3c79694bb7c7437be26d97e_1351910_1110x0_resize_q90_box.jpeg\"class=\"  img-fluid\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\"\u003e\n\u003c/picture\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/20230430-1/","title":"Galway Wind Park"},{"categories":["Race Report"],"contents":"It was the last round of The Bog Trials and that can only mean one thing, burgers. As usual I had a nice long sleep on the way down to the race. When I awoke I was surprised to see the sun was shining. As was becoming tradition, we stopped to get some doughnuts on the way which we share with the other riders. I was a little worried that they were going to melt (or worse still be eaten by Josh). I used the rest of the journey to catch up on some reading.\nWhen we got there we put on our kit, unloaded the bikes and cycled down to the start line to collect our race numbers. I lead Molly and Josh on a pre ride of the course. The pace was high so I think someone must have had their Weetabix. After the pre ride I put on some warm kit while I watched the other races.\nThe under age race was up first. They shot off the start line like lightning. By the time that I got my cow bells from the bag they had already zoomed past. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe how fast they completed the first lap. Molly and Josh were off the front and had a small gap to the third place rider with one lap to go. As they were approaching the finish line we knew it was going to be close. Putting each other under pressure they exchanged glances\u0026hellip;who was going to go first? I couldn\u0026rsquo;t make out who crossed the line first and they are still arguing about it but the race results show Josh as the winner. The finishers had a look of exhaustion but happily munched on their Krispy Kreme doughnut.\nThe B Race was up next and my dad looked focused. He had only gotten a few hours sleep the night before so was very tired but that didn\u0026rsquo;t stop him putting in a few big efforts. He hung on throughout the race to secure the final step on the podium. When he got his breath back he was straight over to the grill and gobbled down a delicious burger.\nI was excited to line out in the women\u0026rsquo;s race again. It was a small field of four but where it lacked in numbers it made up in strength. It was a tough race competing against some amazing women, Laura, Kathrine and Sinead. I focused on a few things that I wanted to work on from the previous race the week before.\nExhausted, Josh lay on the ground beside our gear. He had a fluffy dry robe on and was wrapped up in extra layers. He had fallen asleep, his eyes were closed and you could hear him snoring.\nPost race, I had a burger and I have to say it was one of the best I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had. I even think Josh had an extra one and took another for the journey.\nWe had the prize giving and as happened last year, were awarded a unique prize\u0026hellip;a sod of turf!!!

On the journey down I could see it was going to be a wet race. On the pre-ride there was a stiff headwind down one of the straights and there was a chill in the air\u0026hellip;definitely a day for bib tights. I went with overshoes to keep my feet dry (or at least a little less wet).\nThe race started and I could feel the muck spitting up from underneath me. It was mucky but not cyclocross mucky though there was enough that I could just about see through my glasses. The race settled into a nice pace and Liz and I swapped places on the front for the first couple of laps. I got a chance to open a small gap and continued to work to widen the gap as the race went on. Super day of racing and a lot of fun.\nI definitely earned my post race hot chocolate and donut.\nTime for home and I was glad to have remembered to bring a spare change of clothes (but changing in the car under a blanket requires a lot of wriggling ðŸ˜£).\n","date":"February 18, 2023","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cpicture\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_0651_hub23ea73bf3ce61b04a32bca38c2ad557_299424_545x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 575px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_0651_hub23ea73bf3ce61b04a32bca38c2ad557_299424_600x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 767px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_0651_hub23ea73bf3ce61b04a32bca38c2ad557_299424_700x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 991px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_0651_hub23ea73bf3ce61b04a32bca38c2ad557_299424_1110x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\" \u003e\n  \u003cimg  loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/IMG_0651_hub23ea73bf3ce61b04a32bca38c2ad557_299424_1110x0_resize_q90_box.jpeg\"class=\"  img-fluid\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\"\u003e\n\u003c/picture\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/20230218/","title":"The Bog Trials - Round 3"}]
