[{"categories":["Race Report"],"contents":"The weekend started with the long drive from Dublin to Kanturk. The weather on the drive down suggested it was going to be a warm weekend ðŸŒž. The day before the race and we drove the stage one and two route so that we would have more time on race day. We discussed race tactics and how I might animate the race the following day with the focus on what I could learn rather than the result. After a tiring day of travelling it was time to unload the car. We took all of our things into the hotel, brought our suitcases and my bike up to the room before we finally had time to relax. I had my pre race dinner and hit the room early for a refreshing sleep.\nI woke up early and when I opened the curtains I was delighted to see that the sun was out. After grabbing a take away breakfast and loading the car, we went to race HQ for sign on. I was looking forward to stage 1 because I thought the parcours would suit me. After my usual pre-race warm up I tried to time getting to the pen so that I was still warmed up but was able to get a good start position. The u16 race started ahead of us, followed by the u12 race and then it was go time.\nAs there was no separate race for the girls, we had a big bunch of riders all vying for position. Moving around the bunch was tricky and as I moved up for the first climb I bumped a few elbows. I wanted to attack the first climb to see if I could force a split. I went to the front and put in a hard effort which was then taken up by some of the boys. Going over the top there was a large split in the bunch and I was the only girl who\u0026rsquo;d survived the first effort of the stage. We then had a fast technical descent on which I could feel the wind blowing through my hair. Over the next section there was a lot of traffic on the road which helped some of the dropped riders make their way back to the lead bunch. The last few kilometres were through a town and it looked like the bunch I was in was going to to the line. The pace went up on the final climb and it ended in a super fast bunch sprint to the line. I finished the stage 7th overall and just pipped Izzy for 1st girl. I was exhausted but got on the rollers for a cool down before the usual roll out check. Between stage 1 and 2 I made my way back to the hotel, got some quality carbs into me and grabbed as much sleep as I could.\nStage two was a time trial and one of my favourites. Pre-race routine completed I made my way to the start line. Two of the riders in front of me did not make the start line so I had no bunnies to chase. It was a ~7km TT which is my first of the longer u14 distances so I was determined to stay focussed. I was happy with my effort but did leave a bit on the course though I can\u0026rsquo;t complain about 6th overall and first girl. Post race there was some slight drizzle which was welcome as I cooled down on the rollers. After the stage, we drove the stage 3 route before going back to the hotel and relaxing over dinner. The efforts of the day then had me fall straight to sleep (with my treasured bike beside me).\nDay 2 (and stage 3) was a much more relaxed affair due to the later start time. I was able to take my time over breakfast and enjoy the drive to Race HQ. On the way over the sun was shining through the car window although by the time I started warming up it was pouring rain (parent promptly called over with an umbrella). By race call up the rain had cleared, the sun was out and it was starting to warm up. We were neutralised until we got around the first corner after which the pace immediately picked up. The boys clearly had a race plan as there were a lot of attacks from the gun. On a slight drag, I tried to get off the front but was quickly closed down. In hindsight the drag was not steep enough. But thats how the race continued until the approach to the finish. In the last kilometre there was a vying for position with everyone trying to move up. The finish was a short punchy climb and we attacked hard. The race blew apart and as it did one of the riders deviated from his line edging me in toward the kerb on the side of the road forcing me to tap the brakes. I recovered for 7th overall and 2nd girl behind Izzy (super finish Izzy!). Race finished and I cooled down (in more ways than one).\nNow it was time to chill with the girls, grab an ice-cream before heading to the presentations. I already knew the stage and overall results but was delighted to learn that the u14 Orwell Wheelers girls team took the overall u14 team prize. This was only possible thanks to Carlow Road Cycling Club who had allowed Naoise Byrne to guest ride for us to make up the minimum team size.\nGreat weekend and great racing capped off with a recovery swim at the hotel.\n","date":"May 5, 2023","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cpicture\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_4513_hue9c662733479edbf4c70f1c171c1c0fd_964920_545x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 575px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_4513_hue9c662733479edbf4c70f1c171c1c0fd_964920_600x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 767px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_4513_hue9c662733479edbf4c70f1c171c1c0fd_964920_700x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 991px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_4513_hue9c662733479edbf4c70f1c171c1c0fd_964920_1110x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\" \u003e\n  \u003cimg  loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/IMG_4513_hue9c662733479edbf4c70f1c171c1c0fd_964920_1110x0_resize_q90_box.jpeg\"class=\"  img-fluid\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\"\u003e\n\u003c/picture\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/post-6/","title":"Kanturk Youth 2 Day"},{"categories":["Adventure"],"contents":"The day following the final round of The Bog Trials the organiser, Mick, arranged for a social gravel spin around the Galway Wind Park. If you\u0026rsquo;ve never been to the Galway Wind Park, it is the biggest wind park in Ireland and has over 100 electricity generating wind turbines. Throughout the park there is a network of gravel roads around which Mick had planned three different routes for people of different skill and ability.\nI started off the day with a lovely breakfast from a nearby hotel. I travelled with my mum, dad, sister and brother. Unfortunately we ended up getting lost on the way there but luckily we weren\u0026rsquo;t too far away and a few phone calls later we arrived at the right spot.\nAs we were slightly late to arrive I had to rush to get the bikes unloaded, bidons filled and get into my kit. While I was getting myself ready to go for the spin I was able to chat to some of the riders who had raced The Bog Trials series. It was a sunny but breezy day and you could feel the cold nipping at your nose.\nMy mum, brother (Josh) and sister (Molly) rode the shorter route while my dad and I rode the slightly longer route. Three kilometres in and I was descending after a short little kicker, my dad had super tucked his way past me then I saw him pull over on the side of the rocky road. He had a puncture and as we were in a bit of a rush we forgot to pack tubes. Kindly, four nice men from our group stopped and helped us out.\nThere was a really nice view from the top of a nasty leg burner where we then met some very friendly goats. They were lounging by a wind turbine where the little goats were prancing about. We talked about bikes, races and the damp roads as we made our way through a narrow winding pathway. As we made our way up the final stretch my dad attacked for fun and I followed beating him, of course. We pulled over beside our cars and said goodbye to all the people we met that day.\nAll in all, we had a fantastic day out which was a great finish to The Bog Trials.\n","date":"February 26, 2023","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cpicture\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_3982_hu1a5495eae3c79694bb7c7437be26d97e_1351910_545x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 575px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_3982_hu1a5495eae3c79694bb7c7437be26d97e_1351910_600x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 767px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_3982_hu1a5495eae3c79694bb7c7437be26d97e_1351910_700x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 991px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_3982_hu1a5495eae3c79694bb7c7437be26d97e_1351910_1110x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\" \u003e\n  \u003cimg  loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/IMG_3982_hu1a5495eae3c79694bb7c7437be26d97e_1351910_1110x0_resize_q90_box.jpeg\"class=\"  img-fluid\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\"\u003e\n\u003c/picture\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/post-5/","title":"Galway Wind Park"},{"categories":["Race Report"],"contents":"It was the last round of The Bog Trials and that can only mean one thing, burgers. As usual I had a nice long sleep on the way down to the race. When I awoke I was surprised to see the sun was shining. As was becoming tradition, we stopped to get some doughnuts on the way which we share with the other riders. I was a little worried that they were going to melt (or worse still be eaten by Josh). I used the rest of the journey to catch up on some reading.\nWhen we got there we put on our kit, unloaded the bikes and cycled down to the start line to collect our race numbers. I lead Molly and Josh on a pre ride of the course. The pace was high so I think someone must have had their Weetabix. After the pre ride I put on some warm kit while I watched the other races.\nThe under age race was up first. They shot off the start line like lightning. By the time that I got my cow bells from the bag they had already zoomed past. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe how fast they completed the first lap. Molly and Josh were off the front and had a small gap to the third place rider with one lap to go. As they were approaching the finish line we knew it was going to be close. Putting each other under pressure they exchanged glances\u0026hellip;who was going to go first? I couldn\u0026rsquo;t make out who crossed the line first and they are still arguing about it but the race results show Josh as the winner. The finishers had a look of exhaustion but happily munched on their Krispy Kreme doughnut.\nThe B Race was up next and my dad looked focused. He had only gotten a few hours sleep the night before so was very tired but that didn\u0026rsquo;t stop him putting in a few big efforts. He hung on throughout the race to secure the final step on the podium. When he got his breath back he was straight over to the grill and gobbled down a delicious burger.\nI was excited to line out in the women\u0026rsquo;s race again. It was a small field of four but where it lacked in numbers it made up in strength. It was a tough race competing against some amazing women, Laura, Kathrine and Sinead. I focused on a few things that I wanted to work on from the previous race the week before.\nExhausted, Josh lay on the ground beside our gear. He had a fluffy dry robe on and was wrapped up in extra layers. He had fallen asleep, his eyes were closed and you could hear him snoring.\nPost race, I had a burger and I have to say it was one of the best I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had. I even think Josh had an extra one and took another for the journey.\nWe had the prize giving and as happened last year, were awarded a unique prize\u0026hellip;a sod of turf!!! What a fantastic race series.\n","date":"February 25, 2023","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cpicture\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_3895_hue100ba784b29bb1091b7c04569317ab0_1221940_545x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 575px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_3895_hue100ba784b29bb1091b7c04569317ab0_1221940_600x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 767px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_3895_hue100ba784b29bb1091b7c04569317ab0_1221940_700x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 991px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/IMG_3895_hue100ba784b29bb1091b7c04569317ab0_1221940_1110x0_resize_q90_h2_box.webp\" \u003e\n  \u003cimg  loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/IMG_3895_hue100ba784b29bb1091b7c04569317ab0_1221940_1110x0_resize_q90_box.jpeg\"class=\"  img-fluid\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\"\u003e\n\u003c/picture\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/post-4/","title":"The Bog Trials - Round 4"},{"categories":["Race Report"],"contents":"Round 3 and another chance to take on women\u0026rsquo;s field at The Bog Trials.
