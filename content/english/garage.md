<p>I'm really privileged to have the bikes that I have.  I love to spend time on them and they get a lot of use.  I try to learn as much as possible so that I can take care of them mechanically and always help out with washing, cleaning, minor repairs and replacing parts.<p/>

<h4>Canyon Inflite 2021</h4>

    <p>My first Canyon which I absolutely love.  What's a little different about it is that it's a size 3XS so comes with 650B wheels.  It's 650b wheels means that tire choice is particularity limited for cyclocross but it's such a good fit for a rider of my stature.</p>
    <p>I use my Canyon Inflite for cyclocross and gravel.  </p>

    <p>I got my Canyon Aeroad in time for the 2022 road season and have loved riding it ever since.  Like my Canyon Inflite, it's a size 3XS so comes with 650B wheels.</p>
    <p>My Aeroad and I have visited the ground a few times including at the 2022 National Youth Championships but a few scrapes just adds to the character of both bike and rider.</p>
