With only one race to go in this seasons calendar (Sean Sharkey next Sunday) it’s time to reflect on the CX season.

We’re really lucky to have such a committed bunch of people giving us the opportunity to race.  The commissaires, race organisers, MC’s, medical staff, car park attendants, marshals and more.  Friends and club mates who support, encourage and inspire us.  The amazingly talented and knowledgeable photographers who capture our good moments (as well as those challenging ones).

The local, provincial and national leagues keep getting better with amazing courses and facilities brought together with such thought and care.   My fellow riders and their parents.

Thanks to all who make the winter months pass that little bit quicker.  Lets enjoy the last dance on Sunday!
